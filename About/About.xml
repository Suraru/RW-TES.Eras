<description>Changes the localization for dates to match that of The Elder Scrolls lore
For example;
The years 1-2920 will be referred to as the First Era,
2921-2816 Will be reffered to as the Second Era (With 2921 being shown as 2E 1, and 2916 being shown as 2E 896)
2817-3249 Will be the Third Era, which ends on 433
The following dates are not canon, so I made them up.
3250-3019 is the 4th era, ending with landfall on 231
3020-3991 Is the 5th era, ending 911, as referenced by MK's Loveletter to the Fans (which is a reference to Kurt Khulman's birthday)
3992-3961 The 6th era only lasted 29 years, referencing the current age of The Elder Scrolls when this mod was made
3961-4957 Is the 7th era, lasting 994 years referencing the date TES1 Arena was released
4958-5500 Is the 8th era, lasting 543 years to bring the date to the vanilla start date
5501-6055+ Is the 9th era, leaving the current date as 9E 555 as referenced by KIMMUNE
